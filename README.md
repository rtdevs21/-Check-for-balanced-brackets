Write a program to check for balanced brackets in an expression.. Balanced brackets are the pairs and the orders of “{“, “}”, “(“, “)”, “[“, “]” are correct in the given expression.

For example:
[()]{}{[()()]()} is a balanced bracket. 
[({}]) is not a balanced bracket

You will be given a string, you need to check if the brackets are balanced or not. If they are balanced, print “YES”, otherwise print “NO”.

Expected time complexity: O(N)
